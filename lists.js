var description  = `The name of the wind, page 470 (Kvothe and Deoch):

K: So you've known Denna for quite a while

D: Off and on. More off, honestly.

K: What was she like back then?

D: The same. I suppose she was younger, but I can't say she seems any older now. She always struck me as being older than her years. Not old really, more...

K: Mature?

D: No, I don't know a good word for it. It's like if you look at a great oak tree. You don't appreciate it because it's older than the other trees, or because it's taller. It just has something that other younger trees don't. Complexity, solidity, significance. Damn if that isn't the worst comparison I've ever made.

K: It's nice to see I'm not the only one who has trouble pinning her down with words.

D: She's not much for being pinned down. D: She was just as restless then, and wild. Just as pretty, prone to startle the eye and stutter the heart.

Shortly after the above (Deoch to Kvothe):

D: No, I do not envy her life. Nor do I judge her. For all that, I would help her, if she would let me. But sheâ€™s not the sort to be beholden to anyone.`;
